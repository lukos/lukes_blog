I am called the Head of Technology and work at SmartSurvey in Gloucestershire, UK, a small but influential online data collection
company running a Dotnet/IIS/SQL Server stack but with some movement towards containerisation and microservices.

My various specialisms:

* Dotnet webforms, MVC, core
* Web services, REST, JWT
* Databases - mainly SQL Server, profiling and performance
* Web application security, hashing algorithms
* Highly scalable architectures including cloud/global infrastructure
* Designing for microservices

Languages I have used in my career

* C#, VB.Net
* C/C++
* PHP
* Java
* Objective-C
* SQL

I am usually happy to speak at developer events for expenses.

It goes without saying that these views are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
