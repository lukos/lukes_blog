# Luke's blog
It's me! Luke Briner, Head of Technology at SmartSurvey and general know-it-all.

This is my [blog](https://blog.lukebriner.net/), a static site generated from Jekyll. Why have I made the repo public? No reason really. Nothing here is private so maybe it will help people find some useful content or see how my blog is wired up.

You can use my content but anything significant needs to be attributed and I don't want you making money off of any of it (unless you directly refer to it), freely you have received, freely give!
