<p>&nbsp;I bought an Octavia estate last year just before lock down and was pleased to own the newest and nicest car I ever had. it had all the mod cons including an automatic stop-start system, which I am sure you all know about.</p><p>After a while I had a number of issues with it, and the car generally. I took it to the approved dealer and they said there were no fault codes.</p><p>The problems included:</p><p>occasional high rpm before gear change (it's automatic)</p><p>start stop would not cut the engine due to high energy usage, even though nothing was obviously running</p><p>sometimes the engine would really struggle to start</p><p>one time the display showed a stop start error but mostly it was just strange behaviour.</p><p>Well it seems like it was related to a low battery, probably caused by lots of short journies during lockdown. The last time I took it to the garage, it wouldn't start again! I bought a small charger from Amazon for 30 quid and as soon as I connected it, it showed a very low battery so I left it to fully charge.</p><p>Next time I went out, the car started easily, the stop start cut within a few minutes when I stopped despite the air con running. it all looks like it might be good.</p><p>However, for an unreliable component like a battery, why on earth wouldn't the car detect the low voltage and show the error on the dashboard? I have already paid the garage 60 quid originally to try and fault find when a charger might have been the only problem!</p>
