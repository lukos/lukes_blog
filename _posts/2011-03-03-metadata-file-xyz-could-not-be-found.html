I got loads of errors like this in a VS2008 project the other day. It seemed really confusing since these errors related to files I had not even touched.<br />It turned out that a dependent project had not been built - which had not stopped the solution building - which meant the project references of other projects had nothing to reference and therefore could not find the metadata.<br />Looking up the output window to the <em>first</em> error showed what actually caused the problem and fixing this, got rid of the cascaded errors.
