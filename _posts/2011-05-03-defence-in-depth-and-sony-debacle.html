Well I say debacle but to be fair probably only because you expect someone as large as Sony to have all the best security experts but it again underlines something I have mentioned many times before. The security issues are well known and documented and have been for a long time, the problem is that most companies do not have the processes or quality control to actually audit these things. People make software updates, buy-in third-party software, contract out parts of the system to others who they cannot guarantee and all sorts of things, these are day-to-day realities of IT companies but yet so many organisations are simply too lax with security. At least the data that was stolen (or potentially stolen?) from Sony was encrypted so it is perhaps unlikely to be cracked since cracking encryption is extremely difficult if you don't know what encryption method has been used. The problem with credit card numbers is that you know the answer is either numeric or numeric with dashes so you have a crib to the solution. On the other hand, if you ensure your columns are not called CreditCard and ExpiryDate but something esoteric like CX25 and EX54 and possibly even padded to a fixed length then people are unlikely to be able to deduce what the data is that they have stolen!<div>Even basics like locking out accounts that have been accessed too many times or with multiple incorrect passwords makes it so much harder to brute-force attack systems.</div><div>So many options, so much documentation, so little motivation!</div>
