A news story today warned of thousands of internet users being asked to change passwords after a hack exposed login details. What was worrying was how many people used passwords such as 123456 or "password" which are clearly not secure in the slightest. What was interesting was that it took a hack to make various providers ask their users to change their passwords rather than simply not allowing them in the first place.<br />Quite clearly a brute force attempt at someones password will start with around 20 common words, phrases or number combinations, it would appear that thousands of people would fall foul of that.<br />What do we do? Firstly, if we allow people to choose their own passwords, we simply either blacklist certain words like "password" and/or we use a minimum password strength such as one letter, one number, one capital etc (although this can annoy people if taken to an extreme).<br />The other thing we should do is run a tool against our current users' passwords and work out which ones are not secure and then reset those accounts, sending an email or a page messages saying that your password is too insecure.<br />The other thing that seems sadly lacking is simple intrusion detection so that, e.g. 3 attempts at a password locks out the account for a period or permanently until reset. Even if you use a simple password, if the tool only gets 3 chances to crack it, it is unlikely to succeed.<br />Come on people, let's be proactive and not be tomorrow's headline.
