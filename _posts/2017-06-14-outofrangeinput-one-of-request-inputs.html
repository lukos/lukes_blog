Setting up a new environment that was (theoretically) the same as an existing system. Created a new CDN on Azure, pointed it at blob storage and tried to access it and Azure gives you a rather esoteric (and apparently catch-all) error.<br /><br />Most answers that I found related to using invalid naming i.e. requesting a table with upper-case letters, when tables are not allowed to have upper-case letters (which matches the error message).<br /><br />The issue here is that the CDN is hiding an error that is actually a storage error and, surprise, surprise, is nothing to do with the request but is related to a permission error.<br /><br />I had setup the storage blob with "Private" permission but it actually needs "Blob" permission, which allows anonymous to read but not write blobs.<br /><br />I updated it to use the correct permission but it still didn't work because.....it's a CDN and everything takes ages to propagate. I waited a while and it worked.
