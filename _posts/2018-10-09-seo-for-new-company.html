I hadn't really thought much about getting business for my new company, I just assumed networking would make it all happen but my website is still very background on Google, even if you search for it by name!<br /><br />Anyway, to hopefully help with the SEO score, here is a link to Cotswold IT Consulting, a local (Cheltenham, UK) and independent company helping small and medium businesses with marketing, strategy and software issues.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.cotswolditconsulting.co.uk/">https://www.cotswolditconsulting.co.uk/</a><br /><br />I will be blogging on that site too although they are likely to be shorter and less detailed than this blog.<br /><br />
