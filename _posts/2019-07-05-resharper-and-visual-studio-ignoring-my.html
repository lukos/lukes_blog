I had a weird one today, some things should just work but they don't and I was creating a brand new unit test project in DotNet core to test a DotNet core api controller. I added NUnit, added a simple test and when I tried to run it, it showed as ignored.<br /><br />I added another even simpler test that did nothing and the same thing happened.<br /><br />I then found appalling complicated complaints about the various combinations of NUnit, VSTest, DotNet Core and basically my heart sank as I thought I was fighting a losing battle against something that really should just work.<br /><br />The main issue was around the various strange error messages, which did not make any sense to me and included:<br /><br /><ul><li>test case objects missing for the following elements</li><li>ignored: vstest test-case is missing</li></ul>I tried to disable resharper and use VSTest and restarted Visual Studio (it is sad that this is still a solution since unless people can say <i>why</i> it works, it is just a time waster - caching should work and if there are too many ways to invalidate it then it should be removed)<br /><br />Anyway, after one of my combinations, I noticed a message telling me there was an error and to look in the test output window. I assumed they meant the output window (they did) and then I saw this:&nbsp; <br /><ul><li>Testhost process exited with error: It was not possible to find any compatible framework version<br />The specified framework 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '2.2.5' was not found.</li></ul>This is another error that us normal devs should not see and I wouldn't have understood what the problem was except I recalled an earlier blog post about using dotnet core with NUnit <a href="https://medium.com/@daniel.edwards_82928/using-webapplicationfactory-with-nunit-817a616e26f9" target="_blank">here </a>where I remembered he mentioned editing the project file and removing the value of Version for the nuget reference for Microsoft.AspNetCore.App! Yes really.<br /><br />I did this and finally everything cranked back into life.<br /><br />It's these basics that I often moan about because somebody with less experience than me would have bailed a long time before I did. I was only committed because I had already built the target project and need unit tests. If I didn't, I would simply tell everyone that .Net is a nightmare and the MS teams seem unable to keep the quality in their releases.
