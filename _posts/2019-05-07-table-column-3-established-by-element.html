I am trying to tidy up some HTML and am using the w3c validator at https://validator.w3.org/nu/ but am getting a strange error:<br /><br /><b><span>Table column 3 established by element <code>td</code> has no cells beginning in it.</span></b><br /><br /><span>It points to the first row in the thead of the table. The relevant markup is shown below, can you see what the problem is? (clue, it's what caused the error):&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>https://gist.github.com/lukos/ccc821ac021fb06ffb7b9788bbb84cc9</span><br /><br /><span>In my case, there were other tables that were the same(?) so why were some failing.</span><br /><br /><span>Look closely and you will see the colspan elements. colspan=5 in the first row of the head,&nbsp; 3 in the second row of the head, 2 in the first row of the body and 5 in the second. Effectively, the third column doesn't exist, it is inferred in 4 places but at no point does a row have an actual 3rd column so it is an error. In other words, we should have used colspan=4, 2, 0 and 4 so that the first row of the body would have defined the 4 concrete columns.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Easy when you know how!</span><br /><span><br /></span>
