I was following my own instructions for installing elasticsearch but attempting to run the service and it ended up exiting with this rather unhelpful message in syslog.<br /><br />There are probably other logs but like many applications, they are not designed to be user friendly, perhaps because the developers never have an trouble setting it up!<br /><br />Anyway, after some searching, I found out that ES carries out certain bootstrap checks on start and if they fail, it exits with a status code (and presumably some message somewhere!)<br /><br />In my case, by setting an explicit IP address in elasticsearch.yml for network.host, it switched ES into production mode which runs the checks.<br /><br />All I had to do was set <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;">discovery.type: single-node</span> in the same file, which sets it back into dev mode.
