I got this error after opening an existing VS2015 project after upgrading to Windows 10. I had definitely used this successfully before the upgrade and as usual, it's a very unhelpful message.<br /><br />All the projects loaded apart from one and clicking "reload project" made the error display.<br /><br />The issue is that User Account Control, which was previously disabled in Windows 7 was re-enabled. This meant that Visual Studio was not being opened as Administrator and rather than having a useful error, it shows this instead. I looked in the window at the bottom and something else was displayed about IIS that was more specific to the access permission problem.<br /><br />I need to disable UAC again since giving permission every time you open VS is a pain!
