This was probably the slowest thing I have ever run on Linux (Raspbian on a Rasp-pi to be exact) and to be fair, it does say, "This is going to take a long time".<br /><br />I think it took something 20 minutes and then.....<br /><br />Can't open dhparams.pem for writing, Permission denied!<br /><br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br /><br />Remember Luke, it can't write it into /etc/nginx unless you use sudo!<br /><br />Security is so slow, wouldn't it be nice to buy ready-made ones from the internet ;-)
