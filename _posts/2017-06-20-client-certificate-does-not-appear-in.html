This is one of those jobs I have done several times but couldn't remember why it didn't work the next time.<br /><br />You add a client certificate to your personal store under Current User, it is in-date, it chains OK but when using Windows Credential Manager to add a connection, it doesn't offer you this certificate to choose,.<br /><br />As pointed out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26098918/1688830" target="_blank">here</a>, you have to edit the properties of the certificate and untick "Smart Card Logon" and "Any Purpose" otherwise Windows will ask for a Smart Card to access the client cert!
