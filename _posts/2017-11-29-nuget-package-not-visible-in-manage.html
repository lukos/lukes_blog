I had published a package to a private NuGet repo and even though it was visible in one project, it was not visible in another. I looked on the server and it was definitely there.<br /><br />This happened because the NuGet package was targeting .Net 4.6.1 but the project was only targeting 4.5.1 so it was simply not listed.<br /><br />I updated the project to 4.6.1 and the package appeared!
