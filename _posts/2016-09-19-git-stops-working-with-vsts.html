Annoying bug with no obvious cause!<br /><br />I have been using Git (via Tortoise Git) to push code to VSTS. I've been using it all day and then suddenly, "Git did not exit cleanly- Authentication failed".<br /><br />After re-entering my credentials about 5 tims, each time taking even more care that I was typing them in correctly, it wasn't making any difference.<br /><br />I fixed it in the end by changing my alternate credentials in VSTS to the <i>same</i>&nbsp;password as before but it looks like the act of saving it had refreshed the privileges and then it worked.<br /><br />You can get to that by clicking your name in the top-right of VSTS and choosing Security-&gt;Alternate Credentials.
