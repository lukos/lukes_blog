I'm trying to write something that generates Word documents from a database which can then be modified by a user to include optional fields - things that will change and need updating in a document.<br />I'm having a bit of a struggle working out how to do it but I thought about old-school DDE and embedding LINK fields into Word. It is not ideal since it requires an absolute file path but I thought I would try it out. I could then create building blocks based on these LINKs and allow users to add them in. I attempted to copy the example in the Word help and surprise, surprise, it didn't work at all. I kept getting various errors all amounting to the fact that the field was invalid. I tried all sorts of options and almost gave up when someone mentioned the easier way to do it!<br />Copy the cell(s) in Excel that you want to use and then use Paste Special in Word to paste as a link (it's an option on the left-hand side of the dialog). It will automatically create the correct format for the LINK field (in my case some slightly different switches) and should all be good.
