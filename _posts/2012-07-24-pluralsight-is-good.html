A friend recommended me to Pluralsight Training and I now have a subscription. It's a great idea and something that is way overdue. Training tends to be either very expensive and classroom based, or it is obtained by reading a book or it can be quite amateur on YouTube or whatever. For a reasonable monthly charge of $30, I get unlimited access to all their courses.<br />One of the things I like about the setup is that I can find out about technologies that I might never otherwise have heard of because they are all listed in the training library. Of course, as with any training, one of the great things is learning more about subjects you already thought you had good knowledge of by listening to training run by people who know more.<br />Anyway, get there and learn - let us be professionals!
