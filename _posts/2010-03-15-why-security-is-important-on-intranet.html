I have heard people say that security is not important when dealing with internal web applications, that is ones that exist behind a firewall and which are only used by employees, all of which will have a user login. The argument is that we trust our employees by and large and that the firewall means we do not have to concerned with annoymous hackers who might attack apps exposed to the www. Unfortunately this logic is ill-conceived and simply wrong. Here are some reasons why this approach is bad.<br /><ol><li>Just because an app is behind a firewall doesn't make it unreachable from the net. Firewalls can sometimes be hacked, it might be disabled accidentally long enough to get to your web app at which point damage can be caused. It is like having a castle whose only defence is an outside wall. However hard it might be to penetrate, once it is, the castle falls.</li><li>Although there is a general trust of employees in most companies, it is not correct to decide security policy based on this. Even employees can act maliciously or curiously and can do anything from deliberate damage to accidental damage so the system must treat them as untrusted, only giving them what they need. If something was to be changed then at least it can be narrowed down to the few people who have access to a certain part of the app. If a certain area has common access, audit all important operations so that you can tell quickly and easily who has done something. Maybe they acted ignorantly and need training, maybe they were trying to damage the system.<br /></li><li>Adding the security code to a reasonable degree is not massively difficult. Most of the information exists on the web and lots of code has already been written. Why leave it out and then potentially in the future, when exposing it to the www, would you try and retro-fit it with all the work and risk that involves. Why not put it in at the beginning. There are several reasons why an app might be exposed to the www so why base policy on the fact that it never will?</li><li>Effective defence means defence-in-depth. It means you rely on several measures to protect a resource, like several walls in your castle, so that even if the outer wall is broken, you have time to counter the attack before the inner walls are broken - this is just common sense. Relying on a single defence and assuming that there is little chance of an attack is small consolation after such an attack occurs. This is worse if what you are protecting is valuable or covered by statute and where you might have to excuse your policy before a judge or enquiry. </li></ol>Just think about it, read about it and do it!
