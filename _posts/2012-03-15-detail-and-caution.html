Many times in my life, I have been guilty of not taking enough time to ensure I understand what someone is communicating and end up mis-understanding them. We could say this is life but in the commercial world, some mistakes are simply not worth making because they can involve time, money, reputation and legal issues.<br />One such email from someone at work asked what would happen if a certain program failed because of a permission problem. My assumption was that since this program wrote to disk, the man was talking about a file permission and I responded accordingly, pointing out a potential glaring omission in functionality. Fortunately, someone else who read the email was aware of a problem which actually related to a permission calling a service and which, when I looked into it, was much more mundane and didn't cause any problems other than the program crashing.<br />I guess "measure twice/cut once" should apply to software as much as the building trades!
